            "solution": "As part of the new construction of the indoor swimming pool and the redesign of the tennis club, the entire electrical installation was implemented on a KNX basis. Using the API of the GotCourts reservation system, Loxone can control the lighting depending on the reservations. This means that the lights are only switched on when required, taking into account the ambient brightness.",
